### Hi there 👋
I am Rodrigo Munoz Salas and I am a Computer Science student. I am very interested on working and supporting in several programming projects as well as learning new techniques, methodologies, and algorithms.
I have programming experience with Java, Python, C, and Golang.
I have worked with Docker to build, share, and run applications within a safe environment.
I have employed frameworks such as PyTorch, LangChain, and Streamlit for the development of AI applications.

Hi everyone! I am very interested on working and supporting in several programming projects as well as learning new techniques, methodologies, algorithms, etc.
that might help not only me but also the people I work with. I am currently learning Java; however, I have some previous knowledge from C and C++.

About me, I started in this world not far ago, but I am willing to learn and collaborate in any project if possible. Some of my hobbies are related to music, sports,
and gaming.
